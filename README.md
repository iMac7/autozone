## Roadmap for the near future

### Frontend
Better designs needed overall

#### Landing page
- Location based chats (design concept below)

- chats can be global or tailored to different locations
- better pagination for chats

#### Profile
- Test that the in-app share vehicle button works with an actual vehicle


#### Backend
- Keep a record of authenticated users
- Dynamic leaderboard from an actual database, shifts weekly. (Still making sense of some metrics here)
- Handle storing groups by location (Lens does not support this particular feature exactly). Will work alongside the landing page
